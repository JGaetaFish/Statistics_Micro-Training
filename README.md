# IEP Workshop Statistics Micro-Training Sessions

Whether fresh out of school or a seasoned scientist, this year’s R workshop should have a training session that can help you take your science to the next level. We will have 13 micro-trainings talks that will help guide attendees through a range of topics from data exploration to non-linear regression. Each micro-training will include a 15-minute talk guiding attendees through a specific data analysis step or method followed by a short question and answer period. Each micro-training will also include an IEP-based dataset to analyze, an R script that attendees can use to replicate the presented analysis, and a document that is a companion text to the talk. The users can download these for future reference and to serve as a foundation for future analyses. 

The first session, titled “Basic Statistics in R”, will include five micro-trainings to help guide the pre-analysis process and introduce users to several univariate and multivariate approaches to analyze categorical data. The second session, titled “Regression in R”, will have five micro-talks that introduce users to numerous regression approaches from simple linear regression to handling zero-inflated catch data. The final session, titled “Advanced Analytical Topics in R”, will cover mixed-effects regression and introduce users to regression in a Bayesian framework. We encourage attendees to stick around after the last talk for an open Q&A period. 

Overall, we hope this workshop will provide tools that can help attendees promote to the next level, increase the impact of their next publication, or even just provide a baseline understanding of a suite of commonly used analytical approaches. We look forward to seeing you all at our micro-trainings on March 23, 2022.
